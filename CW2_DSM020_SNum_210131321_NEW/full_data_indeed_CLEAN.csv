In recognition of its increasing importance, the World Health Organization recently included burnout syndrome in its International Classification of Diseases. Engagement is the conceptual opposite of burnout and one means to help prevent burnout. In sport, however, the health implications of burnout and engagement have been overlooked. As such, this project aims to explore the mental and physical health consequences of burnout and engagement for athletes. The project will include studies that examine psychological (e.g., insomnia), physiological (e.g., hypercholesterolemia), and biochemical outcomes (e.g., antibodies). The project will therefore suit someone with a strong background in sport and exercise psychology but with an interest in applying interdisciplinary techniques to the sport context.For informal enquiries contact Dr Daniel Madigan d.madigan@yorksj.ac.uk and/orDr Sarah Mallinson-Howard s.mallinson-howard@yorksj.ac.ukSport SociologyWelfare, duty of care, and wellbeing in sportWhile sport is often lauded for its positive effects, the welfare and wellbeing of all those involved should not be taken for granted. Indeed, in 2017, as part of the Sporting Future strategy, the Minister for Sport commissioned an independent review into the “duty of care” sport has towards its participants. This review highlighted several themes for those working in sport including discrimination and language, and transitioning in, through, and out of sport. However, many priority actions identified from these themes have yet to be implemented. Consequently, sitting in the Tackling Welfare in Sport (TWiST) Research Group, this project aims to further explore some of these important issues. Specifically, the project will examine safety, injury, and medical issues in sport from a sociological perspective.

In recognition of its increasing importance, the World Health Organization recently included burnout syndrome in its International Classification of Diseases. Engagement is the conceptual opposite of burnout and one means to help prevent burnout. In sport, however, the health implications of burnout and engagement have been overlooked. As such, this project aims to explore the mental and physical health consequences of burnout and engagement for athletes. The project will include studies that examine psychological (e.g., insomnia), physiological (e.g., hypercholesterolemia), and biochemical outcomes (e.g., antibodies). The project will therefore suit someone with a strong background in sport and exercise psychology but with an interest in applying interdisciplinary techniques to the sport context.For informal enquiries contact Dr Daniel Madigan d.madigan@yorksj.ac.uk and/orDr Sarah Mallinson-Howard s.mallinson-howard@yorksj.ac.ukSport SociologyWelfare, duty of care, and wellbeing in sportWhile sport is often lauded for its positive effects, the welfare and wellbeing of all those involved should not be taken for granted. Indeed, in 2017, as part of the Sporting Future strategy, the Minister for Sport commissioned an independent review into the “duty of care” sport has towards its participants. This review highlighted several themes for those working in sport including discrimination and language, and transitioning in, through, and out of sport. However, many priority actions identified from these themes have yet to be implemented. Consequently, sitting in the Tackling Welfare in Sport (TWiST) Research Group, this project aims to further explore some of these important issues. Specifically, the project will examine safety, injury, and medical issues in sport from a sociological perspective. The project will, therefore, suit someone with a strong background in the social sciences and has experience of adopting qualitative research methodologies.For informal enquiries contact Dr Graeme Law g.law@yorksj.ac.ukIn addition to a competitive salary, YSJ employees enjoy access to a superb range of benefits including –Generous annual leave entitlement (plus additional leave days during our Christmas closure period)Pension schemeHealth cash planTraining and developmentDiscounts at a range of local companies, including shops, cafes and restaurants.The University is committed to promoting a diverse and inclusive community – a place where we can all be ourselves.

However, immediately after walking into CSI Media, I felt it was the place for me. The people are friendly, and the working environment is brilliant. I listen to my tunes whilst coding, and the office dog occasionally pops over to say hello - you don't get that in many offices!“Within three weeks of applying, I was part of a development team working on a multi-platform solution for a big security company. The work can be challenging, but I am supported by two Tech Leads and a Project Manager with whom I work closely. All three are very helpful; they encourage me to share ideas, and we have gone on to implement a few of them! Seeing your ideas and code you have written in a live project being used by thousands of people every day is very rewarding.“Within the last couple of months, the Directors approached me to ask if I would like to train to become a Tech Lead. Moving forwards, I will manage two projects and help to support a team of developers. One of the projects is for an international Escape Room brand, so it doesn’t get much more exciting than that!“If you’re looking for a career in Tech where you continuously develop your skills, build your confidence, use the latest tech, collaborate with a great team, and where your work has a real-life impact on companies, I highly recommend applying for CSI Media’s graduate roles.”Job Types: Full-time, PermanentSalary: £26,000.00-£30,000.00 per yearBenefits:ChildcareDiscounted or free foodOn-site parkingSchedule:Monday to FridayWork remotely:No",CW1 6ZQ,Crewe ,1,0,0,0,0,10000,26000,30000,28000
